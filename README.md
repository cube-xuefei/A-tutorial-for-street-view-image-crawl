# A-tutorial-for-street-view-image-crawl

## 1. Intro
   To climb Street View Images, you need to use three tools: a website that can download the city road network (eg: Open Street Map, Government website...), a road network processing tool to obtain street view images' coordinates (arcgis, qgis...), and a python interpreter to run the crawl program (pycharm, vscode,jupyter notebook...).  
   
   In this tutorial, I use Open Street Map, ArcGIS and pycharm. 

## 2. First Step: Download the city road network
  Open Street Map: https://www.openstreetmap.org/ 

## 3. Second Step: Obtain the coordinates of street view images
